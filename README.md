Learning react on youtube from Caleb Curry
Here is a link of his React JS Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_x5LkW6IXs&t=2306s

Props(short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components
- when using props you don't assign any value to props in the child components you only assign values of props in parent components
- props are read-only in the child component. This is a fundamental principle in React to ensure a unidirectional data flow

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
